# Introduction
As one of the first projects to do in java, this one is different because it is linked to old times, I remember sending messages to my friends through Bluetooth but the one who can click the button faster is the one who speaks a lot üòÇ. Project got more evolved and got into an array of possibilities that can be done from a combination of digits (more than 0 digits and less than 5).

Also it was a good practice to make test cases in new a language as Java (despite that there wasn't that much of a difference between them)

# How-it-works
1. The base function that does most of the functionality `letterCombinations()` has a dictionary of the digits as the key and their equivalent of character are the value.
2. Constraints on the input digits :

<ul style="margin-top:-1rem; margin-left:1rem;">
<li>Input can't be less than 1 digit and more than 4 digits
<li>The phone dial-pad doesn't have a character on the 1 button, so the app will remove (or replace with nothing üòâ) it from the input.
<li>In case input has only 1('s) then it will throw a custom made exception `outOfScope()`. 
</ul>

3. Calls the function `helper()` that will do the tree operation of having every character make a different concatenation with the others (in case of multi digits entered as input).

There are **5 unit tests** made to make sure it covers as many possibilities for input (including exceptions).

removeThe1s(): get rid of the 1('s).

longInput(): throw of exception in the case of more than 4 digits as input.

test1Number(): just the normal output when 1 digit is entered.

nullInput(): throw exception when there is no input.

test2Numbers(): more output to be tested in case of entering  2 digits.



> ‚ö†Ô∏è If somehow you can't add the library for test cases (like me) then follow [this][1] guide to add it manually.
